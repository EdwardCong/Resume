\lettersection{About Me}

I am a Computer Engineering in my final year at Lassonde School of Engineering, York University. I am a quick-learner and am able to work both independently and as part of a team. I am interested in utilizing/improving skills I have gained throughout my coursework and work experience, as well as developing new transferrable skills.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have gained experience in many programming languages through coursework, such as Python, MATLAB, C, Java, and I have developed in Windows and Unix/Linux. In my previous Co-op I worked as part of a team on a large web conversion of the Public Accounts of Canada 2018, the junior members of the team were commended for our efficiency during the project as we finished by the deadline and did not delay the project. Our team used guides created and maintained by past team members, which included instructions on how to complete the tasks and solutions to common problems. I was commended by my manager for my diligence and initiative as I assisted other team members with any issues while also completing my own sections. I am also experienced in customer service and User Experience from both coursework and previously working in a retail environment. Also, from my previous work experience I have strengthened skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, as I would often need to talk to many angry people daily.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application, if you would like to contact me, I can be reached on my cell phone at 647-868-4912, or by email at edward-cong@outlook.com, I look forward to your response.
